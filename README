Honestly, it what it sounds like.

It currently only supports a single method (getinfo) for subway systems (that I
know about) with actual web pages for individual stations.

    * Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)

    * Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)

    * New York Metropolitain Transportation Authority (MTA)

    * Société de transport de Montréal (STM)

    * Transport For London (TFL)

    * Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)

    * UK National Rail Service

    * Washington Metropolitain Area Transit Authority (WMATA, incomplete as of
      this writing)

Each service has an auto-generated "docs" page and there is support for fake
station web-pages, though the default is to issue a redirect to the
service-specific pages.

For example:

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/bart/ <-- docs 

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/bart/getinfo/16th <-- API

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/bart/station/16th <-- redirect

	http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com/mta/station/550 <-- fake web page

# NERD NOTES

There's a fair amount of boiler-plate code despite current refactoring
efforts. It would be nice to think that the only thing necessary to add a new
service would be a config/description file and have the code magically do the
right thing.

It seems a bit early for that still but, yes, I am thinking about
it. Suggestions are welcome.
